# Phase-1-project-1-challenge-week-3
This project is done by Claire Anita Chepkemoi as required for one to complete the first phase of Software Engineering course at Moringa School,Nairobi,Kenya.

# Library Management System
This is a project system intended for librarians.

The objective for this system are to check in and check out books,update the number of books in the library and the number of books owned by the library.

# A Guide on how to run the application
-Install node js on your computer.

-Install json server on your computer.

-Use any code editor that you are similar with but i would recommend Visual Studio Code.

# Running of the Project 
1. Fork and clone this repository in your computer.
2. Open a terminal and navigate the project directory ie.".../        Phase-1-project-1-challenge-week-3$"
3. Once you have navigated the project directory on the terminal, open the Visual Studio Code and the contents of the index.html will appear.
4. Run json-server--watch db.json in the terminal
5. Go back to the browser and the browser tab where the index.html loaded and refresh the page.
A list of books should appear.

# Navigating through the project
In this project a person can:
1. Explore the books and the categories.
2. "Give out" a book.
3. Add and remove copies of a book available and owned by the library.
4. Delete all recordsof a book by the API.

# Criteria met
- A well documented README.md that can help any developer.
- 20 plus commits in the project with well detailed commit messages.
- This project has a single HTML file.
- This project incorporates at least 3 separate event listeners.

    (a) DOMContentLoaded : in javascript to load the script
    (b) Click : in javascript for all the buttons in the project
    (c) Change : in javascript for the input (search bar) and selection menu
    (d) Hover : in css file for the list items
    (e) Focus : in css for the input (search bar)

# Introduction
A library is a collection of resources,typically books and other printed materials which are organised and maintained for public or private use.

# Problem Statement
A librarian may use a catalog to keep track of the books and printed materials.
It may take a lot of time and energy finding a book in a hardcopy catalog of books that the library owns. The librarian has to cross check that catalog with the data kept after a book has been borrowed or returned.
This activity can lead to boredom and strain on the body for sitting for too long.

# My Project link
My live link is (https://anitanamjoon.github.io/Phase-1-project-1-challenge-week-3/)

# Solution
Single page web-application that does the crucial task of updating a library catalog.

# API used for this project
The API that i used for this project is gutendex API.

# Challenge faced
Coming up with a pleasing and well done design.

Solution: One should draw out the design before writing the html or the javascript.

# Acknowledgement
Moringa School
It has a reallly good Software Engineering learning curriculum and they have th resources which help the students to read through the content.
